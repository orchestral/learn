Getting started with Orchestra Platform 3 is as much identical to getting started with Orchestra Platform 2. Therefore you need to have some minimum knowledge on [Laravel 5](http://laravel.com), [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) and [Packagist](https://packagist.org).

```bash
$ composer create-project orchestra/platform patio dev-master --prefer-dist --dev
```

> Once Orchestra Platform v3.0 is released, you can swap `dev-master` with `3.0.x`.
